Hi Ho, and Well Met, Adventurer! 
You have unearthed the ancient tome of code for my website, 
[ErikGratz.com](http://www.erikgratz.com).

It's a bit of a playground where I test out my ideas.

Bit of extra API here, a bit of experiments in websockets there, might even find a game or two if you snoop hard enough.

Either way, welcome, and I hope you find what you seek. 

_Oh, and try not to disturb the mimics._
